# UI-UX
**UX Design:** UX design is the design of the elements that determine the interaction a user has with a product or service. UX design molds the products and services we use daily to make them easy to use, efficient, and enjoyable for the end-users. Its impact is such that it can make or break a business or brand!
UX designers combine market research, product development, strategy, and design to create seamless user experiences for products, services, and processes.
**UI Design:** UI refers to the actual interface of a product, the visual design of the screens a user navigates through when using a mobile app, or the buttons they click when browsing a website.

UI design is concerned with all the visual and interactive elements of a product interface, covering everything from typography and color palettes to animations and navigational touch points (such as buttons and scrollbars).
**UX and UI go hand-in-hand, and the design of the product interface has a huge impact on the overall user experience.**

**THE DESIGN THINKING PROCESS** 
The Design Thinking Process can be broken down into four different stages: inspiration, conceptualization, iteration, and exposition.

During the inspiration stage, the UX designer seeks to understand and observe. To do this, they conduct extensive research and competitor analysis to fully grasp the problem or challenge they are setting out to solve. This involves interviewing those who are, or will be, directly engaged with the product.

The user experience designer then uses this feedback to identify the userâ€™s goals, emotions, pain points, and behaviors. All of this information helps to form user personas.

The next step is to consider what these personas are trying to accomplish when using a particular product and the journey they will take. The designer considers information architecture and uses various techniques, such as card sorting, to map out user flows.
